You are an expert in regulatory compliance analysis. Your task is to analyze a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document and determine its compliance with relevant regulatory clauses.

### SOP DOCUMENT:
{sop_text}

### RELEVANT REGULATORY CLAUSES FROM {reg_name}:
{clauses_text}

Please provide a detailed compliance analysis report that includes:
1. Overview of the SOP document's purpose and scope
2. Analysis of each relevant regulatory clause and how it applies to the SOP
3. Identification of any compliance issues or gaps in the SOP
4. Specific recommendations for adjustments to bring the SOP into full compliance
5. Summary of compliance status

Format your analysis as a professional compliance report with clear sections and actionable insights.
